1) Within a Github action that runs whever code is pushed, because this allows me to make sure that I am pushing correct code to the main branch, and that if there are any errors, these errors are caught early.
2) No, because an end-to-end test relies on the entire program being run, rather than checking if only a single function returns the correct output. 
3) Navigation evaluates the page's performance during the entirety of its time loading, while snapshot mode only evaluates the pages performance in the specific moment.
4) First, we could add <meta name="viewport"> to make sure the page scales properly across different screens/devices. Second, we could use smaller versions of the images shown, since the Lighthouse results say that images were larger than their displayed size. Third, we should specify the language code since the Lighthouse results say that the <html> element does not have a [lang] attribute.
